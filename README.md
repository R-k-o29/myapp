    we can use React.Fragment

    2. Use {} when embeding JS inside HTML

    3. Tags must be closed/opened properly unlike HTML.

    4. Like HTML here also we will have attributes to elemets but there will be change in few Naming

    5. Values of the attributes must be closed inside "", ''

    6. If the value you want to pass to attribute is Object then you must wrap it inside {}.
